# Elcipse Hono
### Overview

Eclipse Hono provides remote service interfaces for connecting **large numbers of IoT devices** to a back end and interacting with them in a **uniform way** regardless of the device communication protocol[1].

Hono supports devices communicating via common IoT protocols like HTTP, MQTT, AMQP and CoAP out of the box[1].

Eclipse Hono is used in Bosch IoT Hub[2].
