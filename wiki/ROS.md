# ROS

## Overview

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.[4]

* provides hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management[5]
* provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers [5]
* 3-clause BSD license (Open source license)
	* very permissive open license
    * allows for reuse in commercial and closed source products without the need of publishing the source code
* only runs on Unix-based platforms [5]

### ROS1

* ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications

### ROS2

#### Key Concepts [3]

* Nodes: A node is an entity that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes.
* Messages: ROS data type used when subscribing or publishing to a topic.
* Topics: Nodes can publish messages to a topic as well as subscribe to a topic to receive messages.
* Discovery: The automatic process through which nodes determine how to talk to each other.
